When webpack projects 404 on the main.js (or bundle.js), it's because
Express isn't set up to handle static files.

The way I used to set up babel is just completely different now.
Only a few packages are needed, and a .babelrc file seems to be
the easiest way to load presets.

The correct order for style loaders kind of backwards.
style > css > sass.
sass-loader compiles scss into css.
css-loader compiles css into commonjs.
style-loader compiles the commonjs into more js, idk.
But sass is on the bottom, and style on the top.

If no styles are showing, it's because the index.scss needs to be imported
into the index.js file for Webpack to detect it. Don't need to do anything
with it, just add it. No references needed.

.env is cool, but it's case sensitive. be careful. add it to .gitignore.

Keeping react applications organized is going to be tough. try to use
how work does it.
